# JavaScript30: Day 18 - Adding Up Times with Reduce

This is the README for Day 18 of the JavaScript30 challenge, titled "Adding Up Times with Reduce."


## Introduction

Welcome to Day 18 of the JavaScript30 challenge! In this lesson, we'll be exploring how to calculate the total time from a list of video durations using the `reduce` method in JavaScript.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will be working with a list of video durations, represented in hours, minutes, and seconds format (e.g., `HH:MM:SS`). We'll use JavaScript's `reduce` method to calculate the total duration in hours, minutes, and seconds.

The key objectives of this project are as follows:
- Parse the durations in the `HH:MM:SS` format.
- Convert the durations to total seconds.
- Use the `reduce` method to sum the total seconds.
- Convert the total seconds back to `HH:MM:SS` format.
